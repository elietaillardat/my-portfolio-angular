    This Portfolio gathers all the projects and works I consider relevant to expose on this website.
    <hr>
    <p>The <b>Highschool</b> section deals with 
    the two main projects I realized during my Engineering Science course.
    <br>The <b>INSA 1st - 4th</b> shows some of the big works I realized during my course at INSA: electronics design offices, programming
    projects... 
    <br>Finally, the last but not least section <b>Insa 5th Ptp ISS</b>, recovers all the skills I have developed and learnt
    during my last semester at INSA, related to the Internet of Things field and connected objects. This last part works as the evaluation
    for this speciality.
